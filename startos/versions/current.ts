    en_US: `Core Lightning v26.06.9-blake2b.7, based on upstream v26.06.9. We strongly recommend updating.

## Notes for operators

- Updating from the previous version changes nothing else, and the two versions peer normally.
- If the node stops with "80-byte header", its Bitcoin service is not following BLAKE2b. Point it at one that is.
- Channels opened with \`v26.06.7-blake2b.1\` to \`.3\` do not use unified signatures. Close them and open new ones.

This release brings upstream's security and stability fixes, including protection against peers crashing the node and against forwarded funds being lost to a late fulfill while a channel shuts down.

Your node's configuration does not change.`,
